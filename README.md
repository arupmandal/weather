# Local Weather Viewer

![Image alt text](https://i.imgur.com/08ikN4O.png "Main Screen")

Its a web app that shows live weather information and forecast of your current location. You can also search for any location to see its weather info. I've used JavaScript and jQuery along with HTML and CSS to create it. It uses Dark Skies API for fetching weather informations. It also utilizes Google Maps API for all the location related data. I've used [Skycons](https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/), an amazing animated weather iconset made by DatkSkies, to present the weather data.
You can see the app live [here](https://faahim.github.io/local-weather-viewer/).
